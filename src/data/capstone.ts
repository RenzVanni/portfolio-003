The barangay currently uses a combination of paper-based and electronic systems, which is inefficient and costly. OIMS will develop a new system that is both accurate and cost-effective by streamlining the process of gathering and organizing resident information. This will reduce the risk of data inaccuracy and ensure that all information is recorded.",
